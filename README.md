# Bitcoin Gateway for WooCommerce

Self-custody Bitcoin payment gateway for WooCommerce. Bitcoin is paid directly into your wallet. Transactions are verified using public APIs. No private keys are stored on the server. No account is needed with any third party.

_The WooCommerce Bitcoin gateway most philosophically aligned with WordPress and Bitcoin._

## Installation and Use

1. Download, install and activate the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/BrianHenryIE/woocommerce-gateway-bitcoin/releases/). 

This plugin requires PHP's [GMP extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php). If it is not installed on your server, the gateway will not be added to WooCommerce and an admin notice will be displayed explaining why.

![Missing dependency admin notice](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-8.png "Admin notice when required PHP GMP library is unavailable")

If all goes well, you will see a `Settings` link beside the plugin name: 

![Settings link on plugins.php](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-9.png "Settings link on plugins.php")

And in the admin dashboard under WooCommerce/Settings/Payments you will be able to see the payment option listed:

![WooCommerce Payment Gateways list](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-1.png "Once the plugin is active, the gateway will be visible in the WooCommerce Payment Gateways list")

2. From your Bitcoin wallet, copy your "Master Public Key". It should start with `xpub`, `ypub` or `zpub` and then a long alphanumeric string.

<details>
<summary>E.g. Electrum Bitcoin Wallet</summary>

For [Electrum Bitcoin Wallet](https://electrum.org/), it's in the menu under `Wallet`/`Infromation`:

![Electrum Wallet Information Screen](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-2.png "Copy xpub or zpub etc from here")

</details>

Paste that into the payment gateway settings screen and save:

![WooCommerce Bitcoin Gateway settings screen](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-3.png "Paste your xpub into the WooCommerce settings")

Once a master public key is added, the payment addresses are generated.

3. You will now be able to add an item to your cart, head to the checkout and see the Bitcoin payment option:

![Gateway visible on standard checkout](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-4.png "The gateway will be available at customer checkout")

The Bitcoin gateway also works with WooCommerce Blocks checkout:

![Gateway visible on blocks checkout](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-10.png "The gateway works with WooCommerce Blocks checkout")

4. When an order is placed, a payment address is tied to this order and will not be reused. After checkout, this is what the customer will see:

![WooCommerce order thank you page](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-5.png "The thank you page shows the payment instructions")

* The QR code can be scanned or clicked, and contains the address and amount
* "Payment Address" and "Payment Total" are both links which copy the value to the clipboard
* "Last Checked" is a link which queries the blockchain for new transactions
* A background check runs every ten minutes (approximate block time) as long as the order remains on-hold
* The same payment instructions are added to the customer emails
* The customer can view the same payment instructions under `my-account/orders/123`

8. In the WooCommerce admin order UI, the Bitcoin details are visible in a metabox:

![Order metabox](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-6.png "Bitcoin address, amount paid, etc. visible on order UI")

9. WooCommerce's Action Scheduler regularly checks unpaid Bitcoin orders' addresses for new transactions, logs those transactions in the order notes, and marks the orders as paid once the expected amount of Bitcoin has been received.

## Notes

### Custom Post Types

Payment addresses are saved as a custom post type and their status can be seen in a standard WordPress list table:

![Addresses List Table](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-7.png "Standard WordPress list table show addresses and their status and properties: related order, number of transactions, balance, derivation path, last modified date.")

Similarly, wallet addresses (xpubs / master public keys) are saved as a custom post type.

### Templates

All customer and admin UIs can be easily overridden using the standard WooCommerce templating system. 

### APIs

Exchange rate:

* [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) - [API](https://docs.bitfinex.com/docs) - default
* [BitStamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) - [API](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/) - implemented but not in use

Transactions:

* [Blockstream.info](https://blockstream.info/) - [API](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md) - default
* [Blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) - [API](https://www.blockchain.com/api) - implemented but not in use
* [SoChain](https://www.sochain.com/) - [API](https://sochain.com/api/) - deprecated

### Syncing received payments with wallets

Wallets only check a set number of derived addresses for payments and orders may be assigned an address outside the list your wallet is checking. If your store reports a payment has been received, you may need to configure your wallet to look at more addresses.

<details>
<summary>E.g. Electrum Bitcoin Wallet</summary>

In the case of Electrum, in the menu choose `View`/`Show Console`, visit the `Console` tab, and set the lookahead value by typing the following:
```
wallet.change_gap_limit(200)
wallet.synchronize()
```

And please share the plugin with others!

## Motivation and Alternatives 

The previous Bitcoin gateway I used was initially chosen because payments were made directly to a custodial wallet. The company behind it eventually stopped supporting that and only offered the option of a hosted wallet. I also realised after using it for a while that when an order was made, the entire order contents – products, customer address etc. – were being sent to that company's API when the payment address was being generated by them. Totally unnecessary and definitely not GDPR compliant.

Most existing solutions (see [WordPress.org plugin repo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/Bitcoin/)) suffer from one of the following:

* **Non-custodial wallet**. Funds are sent to a wallet managed by another company, which carries the risk of you losing funds due to their security incidents (unfortunately not uncommon), and gives them full view of your financial transactions.
* **Sign-up required**. Many plugins are written to encourage the use of a particular API and this often requires signing up for an account with a third party who should be unconnected to your financial transactions.
* **Profit motivated**. The purpose is often to upsell merchants to currency exchange services, or to charge a transaction fee for the use of the "free" plugin. 

I would like to acknowledge plugins similar to this one, who do not have any of those flaws:

* Sovereign Crypto Payments _by OnionBazaar_ – [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sovereign-crypto-payments/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/onionbazaar/sovereign-crypto-payments)
* Nomiddleman Bitcoin and Crypto Payments for WooCommerce – [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nomiddleman-crypto-payments-for-woocommerce/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/nomiddleman/nomiddleman-woocommerce/)
* Accept Bitcoin _by Bitonymous_ – [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/accept-bitcoin)
* Crypto Payments Woo _by Idan Neeman_ – [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/crypto-payments-woo/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Idan-Neeman/Crypto-Payments-Woo)
* Cryptocurrency Checkout _by Nimiq_ – [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-nimiq-gateway/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/nimiq/woocommerce-gateway-nimiq) 
* Decentralized Bitcoin CryptoDEC Payment Gateway for WooCommerce _by ITLS_ – [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/decentralized-bitcoin-cryptodec-payment-gateway-for-woocommerce/)

WooCommerce are themselves (officially) encouraging the use of crypto (see [It’s Time to Start Accepting Cryptocurrency](https://woocommerce.com/posts/start-accepting-cryptocurrency/), woocommerce.com, 2022-11-02) but the [plugins listed on their site](https://woocommerce.com/cryptocurrency/) are all by venture-capital backed companies.

To use one of those plugins is to eschew Bitcoin's fundamental quality of being a peer-to-peer network.

They are also contrary to WordPress's "open" philosophy. Using this plugin does not preclude you from using the services of any company, and it does not restrict or commit you to any company.

Original development started by [NullCorps](https://github.com/Nullcorps) pre September 2020. BrianHenryIE forked and began using v1.x in March 2022. What helped prompt v2.0, February 2023, was [Bob Dunn](https://bobwp.com)'s podcast episodes:

* [WooCommerce, Payments and Crypto with Keala Gaines and Dave Lockie](https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-payments-and-crypto/), Doo the Woo, 2023-01-10

# Acknowledgements

This plugin is forked from [Nullcorps/woocommerce-gateway-bitcoin](https://github.com/Nullcorps/woocommerce-gateway-bitcoin) who figured out all the core functionality, i.e. the address generation, exchange rates, payment confirmations – everything Bitcoin related. The work here has been to implement that as a modern WordPress/WooCommerce plugin with Action Scheduler, CPTs, Composer, automated tests, WPCS, etc. Thank you, [NullCorps](https://github.com/Nullcorps)!
