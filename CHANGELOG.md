* Fix: Email function was being invoked with an old order object, now refreshes so address metadata will be available.

### 1.0.1

Fixes some teething problems:

* Misspelled const was causing the Settings link on plugins.php not to appear (and maybe deeper problems).
* Address generation now starts when the xpub is saved/changed on the settings screen (bg task via Action Scheduler, so maybe not immediately)
* Gateway will not appear at checkout if there is no destination payment address generated and ready to go
* Exception handling when printing instructions on Thank You page and Emails â€“ now catches the exception (no address) and prints nothing, logs the error
* JS and CSS are now only enqueued on pages whose order used a Bitcoin gateway (previously they enqueued on all Thank You and View Order pages)

### 1.0.0 2022-03-30

* This is reasonably well unit-tested and somewhat tested locally, but has not been run in production yet.
